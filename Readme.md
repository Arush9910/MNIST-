#  MNIST Handwritten
Digit Recognition

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset**. The goal is to accurately classify digit images using deep learning techniques.

---

##  Overview
The MNIST dataset is one of the most popular datasets for image classification.  
Each image is a **28x28 grayscale image** of a handwritten digit.  
This project uses a **Neural Network / Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify these digits efficiently.

## 🧩 Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.  
- Trains a model using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Evaluates model accuracy on test data.  
- Visualizes predictions on sample images.  
- Supports saving and loading trained models.
